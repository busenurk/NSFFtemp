# R Markdown Report Template
This is an R Markdown report template for Faglunsj meeting, 2024. Please use this template for creating .html reports. If you want to venture into the wild realms of Word or PDF output, be prepared to tame interactive beasts like plotly. For this quest, you might need the magic of [webshot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/webshot/index.html) and [htmlwidget](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/htmlwidgets/index.html) packages. Remember, finding bugs is part of the adventureâ€”embrace it, search the web, and may the debugging force be with you! 

Good luck!
